\item{If}{Paternal imprinting effect.}

\item{includeE}{A logical value indicating whether environmental effects
should be included in the simulation.}

\item{Einteraction}{A string indicating what variable environmental effects
interact with.  Can be "\code{Im}", "\code{If}", "\code{C}", or "\code{M}".}

\item{propE}{Proportion of case trios in the environmental exposure group by
population, assumed equal to case population proportion.}

\item{includeControl}{A logical value indicating whether controls should
be included in the simulations.}

\item{propE.control}{Proportion of control trios in the environmental exposure
group by population, assumed equal to case population proportion.}

\item{includePopStrat}{A logical value indicating whether to include
population stratification in the simulation.}
