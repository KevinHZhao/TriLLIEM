\arguments{
\item{mtmodel}{Mating type model to use in the analysis, can be "\code{HWE}" for
Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, "\code{MS}" for Mating Symmetry, and "\code{MaS}" for Mating Asymmetry.}

\item{effects}{A vector listing the effects, as strings, to include
in the model.  Example effects include:
\describe{
\item{"\code{C}"}{Child effects.}
\item{"\code{M}"}{Maternal effects.}
\item{"\code{Im}"}{Maternal imprinting effects.}
\item{"\code{If}"}{Paternal imprinting effects.}
\item{"\code{E:Im}"}{Maternal imprinting by environment interactions.}
}}

\item{dat}{A data frame with triad data, with the formatting of
\link{example_dat4R}.}

\item{PStest}{A logical value indicating whether to perform a population
stratification test on the data.}

\item{includeE}{A logical value indicating whether to include environment
interaction effects.  If set to "\code{FALSE}", any exposed counts in \code{dat} are
combined with the respective unexposed count.}

\item{Einteraction}{A string indicating what variable environmental effects
interact with.  Can be "\code{Im}", "\code{If}", "\code{C}", or "\code{M}".}

\item{Estrat}{A logical value indicating whether to use a stratified approach
for environmental interactions equivalent to that of EMIM and/or Haplin.}

\item{Eanova}{A logical value indicating if this is for the sake of running
anova on a data set with a non-zero "\code{E}" column but without "\code{E}" effects.  Should
be left as "\code{FALSE}" otherwise, as the degrees of freedom will be incorrect.}

\item{includeD}{A logical value indicating whether to use the hybrid
model with controls.  If set to "\code{FALSE}", any control trios will be removed
from the data set prior to analysis.}

\item{includeIm}{A logical value indicating whether to include maternal
imprinting in the model, equivalent to adding "\code{Im}" in the "\code{effects}" vector.}

\item{includeIf}{A logical value indicating whether to include paternal
imprinting in the model, equivalent to adding "\code{If}" in the "\code{effects}" vector.}

\item{Minit}{Initial proportion of maternal inheritence to split the triple
heterozygote cell by if the EM algorithm is necessary.}

\item{max.iter}{Maximum number of iterations for the EM algorithm.}

\item{EM.diag}{A logical value indicating whether to show diagnostic messages
for the EM algorithm.}
}
\value{
An object of class "\code{TriLLIEM}", which inherits from class "\code{glm}".
