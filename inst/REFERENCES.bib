	            polymorphisms (SNPs) genotypes and TopMed-imputed genotypes
	            were obtained for case-parent triads from the EUROCRAN and
	            ITALCLEFT studies. Candidate regions were selected around
	            target SNPs from a previous genome-wide association study,
	            resulting in 12 (726 SNPs) and 11 regions (730 SNPs) for

	            were used to analyze 404 case-parent triads and 40
	            case-parent dyads. p-values were combined across regions.

	            Methods Participants were enrolled in the National Birth
	            Defects Prevention Study between 1997 and 2008. DNA samples
	            from 616 case-parental triads affected by CTDs and 1645
	            control-parental triads were genotyped using an Illumina®
	            Golden Gate custom SNP panel. A hybrid design analysis,
	            optimizing data from case and control trios, was used to
	            identify maternal and fetal SNPs associated with CTDs Results
	            Among 921 SNPs , 17 maternal and 17 fetal SNPs had a Bayesian
	            false-discovery probability of <0.8. Ten of the 17 maternal
	            SNPs and 2 of the 17 fetal SNPs were found within the
	            glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit (GCLC) gene.

	            probability (rs2612101, rs2847607, rs2847326, rs2847324) were
	            found within the thymidylate synthetase (TYMS) gene.
	            Additional analyses indicated that the risk of CTDs
	            associated with candidate SNPs was modified by

	            design uses data from cases and both parents (case/parent

	abstract = {Abstract With case–parent triad data, one can frequently
	            deduce parent of origin of the child's alleles. This allows a
	            parent-of-origin (PoO) effect to be estimated as the ratio of
	            relative risks associated with the alleles inherited from the
	            mother and the father, respectively. A possible cause of PoO
	            effects is DNA methylation, leading to genomic imprinting.
	            Because environmental exposures may influence methylation
	            patterns, gene–environment interaction studies should be
	            extended to allow for interactions between PoO effects and
	            environmental exposures (i.e., PoOxE). One should thus search
	            for loci where the environmental exposure modifies the PoO
	            effect. We have developed an extensive framework to analyze
	            PoOxE effects in genome-wide association studies (GWAS),
	            based on complete or incomplete case–parent triads with or

	                critical to fulfill this aim and biostatistics platforms

	            technology for detection and scoring of single nucleotide
	            polymorphisms (SNPs) has undergone rapid development,
	            extensive catalogues of SNPs across the genome have been
	            constructed, and SNPs have been increasingly used as a means
	            for investigation of the genetic causes of complex human
	            diseases. For many diseases, population-based studies of
	            unrelated individuals—in which case-control and cohort
	            studies serve as standard designs for genetic association
	            analysis—can be the most practical and powerful approach.
	            However, extensive debate has arisen about optimum study
	            design, and considerable concern has been expressed that
	            these approaches are prone to population stratification,
	            which can lead to biased or spurious results. Over the past
	            decade, a great shift has been noted, away from case-control
	            and cohort studies, towards family-based association designs.
	            These designs have fewer problems with population
	            stratification but have greater genotyping and sampling

	abstract = {Abstract The study of the genetic component of early-onset
	            diseases requires investigation into parental genetic effects
	            , particularly those mediated by the mother who can influence
	            the offspring's risk of disease through the effects of her
	            genes acting directly on the intrauterine milieu or
	            indirectly through maternal-gene child-gene interaction
	            effects. An important source of bias that can arise in
	            feto-maternal association testing is the possibility of
	            confounding due to mating asymmetry (MA). However, there is
	            little information on the levels of MA present in human
	            populations and the impact on maternal association testing.
	            In this study, we developed a novel approach to measuring MA
	            and, using HapMap mate-pairs of European and African descent,
	            carried out a genome-wide investigation and characterization
	            of MA. We further investigated the impact of observed levels
	            of MA on maternal association tests through simulation
	            experiments. For the first time, we showed that
	            non-negligible levels of MA are detected in human populations
	            , such that subtle genotype frequency differences between
	            individuals mating in the population are sufficient to induce
	            spurious maternal genotype associations. Though the
	            underlying mechanisms driving the asymmetry within these
	            populations remain elusive, our findings provide
	            consequential evidence for the occurrence of MA in humans and
	            highlight the importance of controlling for MA in maternal
	            association testing. Genet. Epidemiol. 2011. © 2011

	            were reported to the United Kingdom PKU Registry. The effect

	            allele among cases and their parents (e.g., the
	            transmission/disequilibrium test). Existing methods focus on
	            effects of alleles that operate through the offspring

	            compared, with heterogeneity interpreted as gene-environment
	            interaction or G×E. Though generally invalid, such analyses
	            continue to appear. We revisit why heterogeneity is not
	            equivalent to G×E in a range of settings not considered
	            previously. The objective is a fuller understanding of the
	            bias in transmission rates and what is driving it. Extending
	            previously published findings, we derive parental mating-type
	            probabilities in cases and use them to obtain transmission
	            rates, which we then compare to G×E. Through simulation, we
	            investigate the practical implications of the bias for a
	            transmission-based test of G×E. We find that general
	            population characteristics distort the picture of G×E
	            obtained from transmission rates: the stratum-specific
	            mating-type probabilities under G − E dependence and the
	            allele frequency under independence. Furthermore, the
	            transmission-based test has inflated error rates relative to
	            a likelihood-based test. Our investigation provides further
	            insight into how and why transmission-based tests and
	            descriptive summaries can mislead about G×E. For exploring
	            G×E, we suggest graphical displays of the transmission rates
	            within parental mating types, as they are robust to

	            transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT), although the TDT can
	            perform better under an additive model of inheritance.
	            Because a restricted version of the LRT is asymptotically
	            equivalent to the TDT, the proposed test can be regarded as a
	            generalization of the TDT. The method that we describe
	            generalizes easily to accommodate maternal effects on risk
	            and, in fact, produces powerful and orthogonal tests of the
	            contribution of fetal versus maternal genetic factors. We
	            further generalize the model to allow for effects of parental
	            imprinting. Imprinting effects can be fitted by a simple,
	            iterative procedure that relies on the
	            expectation-maximization algorithm and that uses standard
	            statistical software for the maximization steps. Simulations
	            reveal that LRT tests for detection of imprinting have very
	            good operating characteristics. When a single allele is under
	            study, the proposed method can yield powerful tests for
	            detection of linkage disequilibrium and is applicable to a
	            broader array of causal scenarios than is the TDT.",

	abstract = "The development of the DNA theory of inheritance culminated
	            in the publication of the molecular structure of DNA 60 years
	            ago. This paper describes this development, beginning with
	            the discovery of DNA as a chemical substance by Friedrich
	            Miescher in 1869, followed by its basic chemical analysis and
	            demonstration of its participation in the structure of
	            chromosomes. Subsequently it was discovered by Oswald Avery
	            in 1944 that DNA was the genetic material, and then Erwin
	            Chargaff showed that the proportions of the bases included in
	            the structure of DNA followed a certain law. These findings,
	            in association with the biophysical studies of Maurice
	            Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin with Raymond Gosling, led James
	            Watson and Francis Crick to the discovery of the
	            double-helical structure of DNA in 1953. The paper ends with
	            a short description of the development of the DNA theory of
	            inheritance after the discovery of the double helix.",
